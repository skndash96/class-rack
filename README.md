Pain Points:
- There's no official portal to check attendance of the students
- Many students do not know about how many classes they can skip
- Students need a good method to self track their attendance

Solution:
- An app where users can create subjects, set timetable and get notified everyday to mark attendance
- An app that tells you how many classes u can miss

Tech Stack:
- React Native Expo (Typescript)
- Watermelon DB (SQLite with observables)
- React Native Paper
