# class rack
Solving an IRL problem

## pain points:
- only few in a class take good notes during a lecture
- various lecturers send various ppts
- the ppts and notes (pic & pdf) are scattered around in whatsapp (even in drive) and not so organised
- many students dont track their attendance and % may fall below 75
- many students dont know if their marks (of a particular exam) is of average, above or below average
- many students tend to forget due dates or procrastinate to the end

## monetization:
- 1mo free trial. then on, 10/- per mo

## features:
- dauth login: obtain class circle from roll number
- self: attendance tracking
- self: to-do list with reminders
- shared: file storage and easy accessibility of PDFs/ppts/notes as images
- shared: exam mark average, median calculator (anonymity of users)

## please note:
- the app doesn't try to move students from whatsapp group

## bad:
- gdrive fixes file sharing
- gform fixes marks
- gsheets fixes attendance
- greminders fixes reminders
but everything at one place, clean ui, mobile friendly is what i need
